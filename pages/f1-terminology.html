      <div class="term-content">
        <h2>DRS (DRAG REDUCTION SYSTEM)</h2>
        <p>DRS stands for Drag Reduction System. It’s something Formula 1 cars use to go faster on straight parts of the track.

The back wing of the car can open up, which lets air flow through more easily. This reduces drag (air resistance) and makes the car quicker, which helps drivers overtake others.

But they can’t use it all the time. It’s only allowed in certain zones on the track, and only if the driver is within one second of the car in front. It’s a tool to make races more exciting and give drivers a better chance to pass each other.</p>

      <div class="term-content">
        <h2>OVERSTEER/UNDERSTEER</h2>
        <p>
What is it: During cornering, oversteer is when the rear wheels of a car lose grip, causing the back end to step out. Understeer, on the other hand, is when the front wheels lose grip, which sees the car travel at a shallower angle than the one the driver is asking for with the steering wheel. Or to paraphrase the great rally driver Walter Rohrl, if you see the barrier you’ve driven into, that’s understeer. If you hear yourself hitting it, it’s oversteer.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="term">

      <div class="term-content">
        <h2>UNDERCUT</h2>
        <p>What is it: When a driver, struggling to get past another car, pits early in a bid to get a performance advantage from fresh tyres that will hopefully put them ahead when their rival then pits.



This occurs when a team believes fresher rubber will yield more pace and create a net gain over remaining on the track by the time the other car(s) has pitted. Depending on the overarching strategy, the team may fit the same compound again, or one of the other two that are available.



This tactic is often used at tracks where overtaking is more difficult, like the Hungaroring and Singapore, and strategy is the only likely method of progressing. It is also one of the most common strategy tools for overtaking.</p>

    <div class="term">
      <div class="term-content">
        <h2>OVERCUT</h2>
        <p>An overcut is where a driver remains on track longer than an immediate rival in order to try and gain a position.



Two factors can be exploited using this strategy. Firstly, if the driver remaining out on track can maintain or increase their pace compared to a rival who has pitted, they may be able to get ahead of them when they eventually take their pitstop.



Secondly, if a rival that has pitted first is unable to quickly generate tyre temperature and is slower on their out-lap, the driver yet to pit can take advantage of this by increasing the gap between the two before pitting.</p>

    <div class="term">
      <img src="../img/slipstream.webp" alt="">
      <div class="term-content">
        <h2>SLIPSTREAM</h2>
        <p>Slipstream is when one car follows closely behind another car to reduce air resistance and go faster.

Here’s how it works:
When a car drives fast, it pushes air out of the way, creating a pocket of lower-pressure air behind it. If another car drives into that pocket (right behind), there’s less air pushing against it, so it doesn’t have to work as hard and can go faster.

Drivers use slipstream to get closer to the car in front, and sometimes use it to prepare for an overtake — especially on long straights. It’s like getting pulled forward by the air.</p>

    <div class="term">

      <div class="term-content">
        <h2>LIFT AND COAST (liCo)</h2>
        <p>What is it: If a driver is looking like they’re burning too much fuel to get to the end of a race, their engineer might tell them to ‘lift and coast’, meaning that the driver lifts off the throttle and cruises into a braking zone, which uses less fuel – although it obviously slows down their pace.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="term">

      <div class="term-content">
        <h2>FLYING LAP</h2>
        <p> a flying lap, also known as a hot lap or timed lap, is a single lap around a race track where the driver is pushing to achieve the fastest possible time</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="term">
      <img src="../img/blistering.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="term-content">
        <h2>BLISTERING AND GRAINING</h2>
        <p>What is it: Blistering is when the temperature imbalance between a tyre’s hot carcass (the inner bit) and cold surface (the outer bit) cause pieces of rubber to explode out of the tyre, leaving a hole.
 Graining is when the tyre’s carcass is cold and surface is hot, with the resulting flex in the tyre causing the rubber to chunk off and stick to the surface of the tyre, reducing grip.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="term">

      <div class="term-content">
        <h2>BOTTOMING/PORPOISING</h2>
        <p>What is it: Quite simply, it’s when the underside of the car hits the track. It’s usually caused by bumps in the track or a sudden rise or crest, à la Eau Rouge. The act of bottoming was made more spectacular, if you’ll pardon the expression, by the introduction of titanium skid blocks in 2015, which throw off a shower of sparks when the cars’ undersides hit the deck.</p>

      <img src="../img/dirty.webp" alt="dirty air">
      <div class="term-content">
        <h2>DIRTY AIR/CLEAN AIR</h2>
        <p>What is it: ‘Dirty air’ is created by the odd vortices of air spinning off the back of a leading car and reducing the efficient airflow over the wings of the following one, giving it a performance disadvantage by reducing downforce. Clean air is when a car is out on its own, with a nice, undisturbed airflow passing over its wings, providing good downforce.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
            <div class="term">
      <div class="term-content">
        <h2>BRAKE BIAS</h2>
        <p>What is it: When a driver mashes the brake pedal, all four brakes act to slow the car down – but the driver can shift how effective the front brakes are compared to the rears by changing the brake bias.

 In the wet, a driver will usually shift the brake bias more to the rear to stop the front brakes from locking, while drivers will also change the brake bias throughout a race as the balance of the car changes thanks to factors like lower fuel levels and tyre wear.</p>
