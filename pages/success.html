        <h2>PEOPLE BEHIND THE PAPAYA</h2>
        <p>In recent seasons, McLaren Racing has transformed from a struggling midfield team to a genuine front-running force in Formula 1. While much of the spotlight shines on drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, McLaren's true strength lies in the people working behind the scenes — a tight-knit team of engineers, strategists, designers, and leaders who are driving the team's remarkable resurgence.</p>

        <h2>THE BRAIN OF THE OPERATION: ANDREA STELLA</h2>
      <p>McLaren’s Team Principal, Andrea Stella, took over in late 2022 after the departure of Andreas Seidl. A calm, experienced engineer-turned-leader, Stella previously worked with Ferrari and was race engineer to both Kimi Räikkönen and Fernando Alonso. At McLaren, his leadership style has been praised for being methodical, analytical, and deeply collaborative.

He quickly made bold structural changes within the technical department, setting the tone for a culture of accountability and agility. Under Stella’s guidance, the team became more responsive — accelerating car development and empowering department heads to work more independently and efficiently.</p>

        <h2>TECHNICAL BRILLIANCE: PETER PRODROMOU</h2>
      <p>A major force in McLaren’s aerodynamic evolution is Peter Prodromou, the team’s Technical Director of Aerodynamics, who previously worked alongside Adrian Newey during Red Bull’s dominant era in the early 2010s. Since rejoining McLaren, Prodromou has played a crucial role in redefining the team’s aerodynamic philosophy. Under his leadership, the aero department has matured significantly, culminating in the breakthrough upgrades introduced in mid-2023 that transformed McLaren from midfield runners into podium contenders. With his deep technical expertise and vision, Prodromou is shaping some of the most competitive machinery McLaren has produced in over a decade.</p>

        <h2>ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE: THE GARAGE CREW</h2>
      <p>At the heart of every successful Grand Prix weekend is McLaren’s race engineering and garage crew. Lando Norris' race engineer Will Joseph and Oscar Piastri’s engineer Tom Stallard (a former Olympic gold medalist in rowing) are instrumental in managing the flow of information and building trust between driver and team.

In addition, the pit crew consistently ranks among the best for speed and consistency. As margins in F1 continue to tighten, a 2.1-second pit stop can be the difference between a podium or fourth place — and McLaren is among the few teams regularly delivering those lightning-fast stops.</p>

        <h2>THE NEXT GENERATION AND BEYOND</h2>
      <p>McLaren’s investment in people doesn’t stop at the track. The team has revamped its simulator facilities, wind tunnel (set to be a game-changer for 2025 and beyond), and continues to nurture talent from within its ranks. Young talents from programs like McLaren Applied and their graduate engineering pipeline are already making their mark.

The blend of youth and experience, innovation and tradition, has created an environment where talent thrives — and results follow.
